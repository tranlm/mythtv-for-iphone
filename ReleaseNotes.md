## Development Change Log ##

### 2008-05-10 (v0.04 release) ###

All shows are listed from the database now. Shows where a .mp4 file is found, it displays in green. Conversion button added for other shows. However, the conversion button needs to get tied into the Job Queue system of MythTV and right now it is not a clean implementation.

### 2008-04-05 (v0.01 release) ###
